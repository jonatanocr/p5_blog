        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Jonatan, a web developer.</p>
        <p>I enjoy learning new skills in IT, building, and understanding things.</p>
        <p>Ex senior construction technician for 10 years, before graduating as professional diver,
        I currently rather dive deep in web projects using mainly PHP, Javascript, SQL, HTML, and CSS.
        I am also an open source enthusiast, and of course, a Linux user.</p>
        <p>Apart from coding, I enjoy hiking, workout, and martial arts.
            I have always been driven towards challenging my limits and improving my knowledge through hard work.</p>
        <p>Feel free to check-up my Projects and Resume section, which also includes my contact information.</p>
